# gs-rest-service
Spring Boot Java Project with Cucumber Testing
Overview
This repository contains a Spring Boot Java project integrated with Cucumber for automated acceptance testing in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. The project is designed to showcase end-to-end testing using Cucumber for a REST service.

Understanding the Project
Step 1: Clone the Project
Clone the Spring Boot project from the provided GitHub link:


git clone <https://github.com/shishirsaurav/gs-rest-service/edit/main/>
cd spring-boot-cucumber-testing
Step 2: Explore the Project
Explore the project's structure and functionalities to gain a better understanding.

Setting Up Cucumber
Step 1: Add Cucumber Dependencies
Add Cucumber dependencies to the project's build configuration file (pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle). Example for Maven:


<!-- Add Cucumber dependencies -->
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
        <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
        <version>6.10.4</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
        <artifactId>cucumber-junit</artifactId>
        <version>6.10.4</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
Step 2: Set Up Cucumber Environment
Set up the Cucumber environment in your IDE.

Writing Cucumber Test Scenarios
Step 1: Create Feature Files
Create feature files in the src/test/resources directory.

Example: src/test/resources/features/sample.feature

Feature: Sample Feature

  Scenario: Verify Something
    Given some precondition
    When some action is performed
    Then the expected outcome should be observed
Step 2: Write Test Scenarios
Write test scenarios in Gherkin language that describe the expected behavior of the application.

Implementing Step Definitions
Step 1: Create Step Definition Classes
Create step definition classes in the src/test/java directory.

Example: src/test/java/stepdefinitions/SampleSteps.java

java
Copy code
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;

public class SampleSteps {

    @Given("some precondition")
    public void givenSomePrecondition() {
        // Implementation
    }

    @When("some action is performed")
    public void whenSomeActionIsPerformed() {
        // Implementation
    }

    @Then("the expected outcome should be observed")
    public void thenExpectedOutcomeShouldBeObserved() {
        // Implementation
    }
}
Configuring Cucumber Options
Step 1: Configure Cucumber Options
Configure Cucumber options in a runner class or using a cucumber.properties file to specify features, glue, plugins, etc.

Example: src/test/java/runner/TestRunner.java


import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
        features = "src/test/resources/features",
        glue = "stepdefinitions",
        plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports"}
)
public class TestRunner {
}
Executing Tests and Generating Reports
Step 1: Run Test Runner Class
Run the test runner class (TestRunner.java) to execute the Cucumber tests.

Step 2: Generate Reports
Cucumber can generate reports. In this example, it generates HTML reports in the target/cucumber-reports directory.

Reviewing Test Reports
Step 1: Analyze Test Reports
Analyze the generated test reports (target/cucumber-reports/index.html) to check the outcomes of the tests.

Step 2: Identify Areas for Improvement
Identify any failures or areas for improvement in the application based on the test outcomes.

Documentation
Document the entire process, from setting up Cucumber to writing and executing tests. Ensure the documentation is detailed and clear, with steps that can be easily followed by others.
